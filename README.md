# 🐍 Classic Snake Game in Python (Turtle Graphics)

A fun, fully functional **Snake Game** built using Python's built-in `turtle` module. Control the snake with arrow keys, eat food to grow longer, and try to beat your high score — without hitting the walls or yourself!

## ✨ Features

- Smooth snake movement with proper segment following.
- Arrow key controls (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- Prevents 180° instant reversals (realistic movement).
<!-- - Food spawns randomly — never on the snake's body -->
- Score tracking displayed on screen.
- Red boundary walls with visual border.
- Game over on wall collision or self-collision.
<!-- - Clean object-oriented design using classes (`Snake`, `Food`) -->

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **Arrow Keys** to control the snake
- Eat the **red food** to grow and increase your score
- Don't run into the walls or yourself!
- The game ends when you collide — see how high you can score!
